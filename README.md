random notes 


"Did the tutorial as of 3/12/2023 and ran into an issue and it looks like others have had the same problem. If when setting up all of the files and doing the imports you get the error,  "You can mark the path "three" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this
error." all you have to do is run "npm install --legacy-peer-deps three use --force" in terminal. "



npm run build
